# Codifer-VampireCatDemo
Game source files for my entry to a community BlackThronProd Pass-The-Game Challenge. 
Here is the Blackthornprod video, but I didn't submit in time so I didn't make the cut, you can see what the other devs did with the same source files: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqca9LVOAQ&pp=ygUOYmxhY2t0aG9ybnByb2Q%3D

Feel free to tinker, edit, use, etc with the files. Not sure there is much or anything useful but enjoy. 

My video about the process of throwing this together coming soon.
